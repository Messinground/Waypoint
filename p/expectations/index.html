Same goes for your boss. And when someone doesn't comply - there are consequences.</p><p>One thought led to another and I asked myself:</p><h2>What are God's expectations?</h2><p>He sets a high standard. Don't even look at someone with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A21-22&amp;version=ESV">hatred in your heart</a>. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A27-28&amp;version=ESV">Or lust.</a> Forgive everyone <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fsearch%3DMatthew%2B18%253A21-22%26version%3DESV">every time.</a> Treat even your enemy <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A27-31&amp;version=ESV">as you want to be treated.</a> Be <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A12-13&amp;version=ESV">willing to die</a> for those you love (which should mean everyone.) These are what we might call his "expectations." But what does he actually <em>expect</em>?</p><p>He anticipates that we've <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&amp;version=ESV">already sinned.</a> He knows that we <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+7%3A20&amp;version=ESV">continue to sin.</a> And he predicts that in our imperfection, we will unfortunately <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A8-10&amp;version=ESV">keep on sinning.</a></p><p>Even so: <strong>1 John 2:1 </strong></p><blockquote><p>"My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."</p></blockquote><p>There are four obvious takeaways:</p><ol><li>He does not want us to keep sinning</li><li>God and his people actively work to minimize sin</li><li>He isn't surprised by the fact that we keep sinning anyway</li><li>He prepared for it and made a plan to deal with it</li></ol><p>So note to self:</p><h3>Stop punishing yourself for being imperfect</h3><p>Let's say Jeff invites Andrew on a hike, but Jeff knows Andrew is in a wheelchair. Andrew says no at first, knowing he would progress a lot slower and couldn't go to all the same places that Jeff can. He's just not capable. But Jeff is persistent. He asks and asks Andrew to join him until he finally gives in.</p><p>So should Andrew beat himself up for slowing Jeff down? Should Andrew be upset when he has to really on Jeff to carry him and his wheelchair through unpaved sections of the trail? Of course not! <strong>Jeff invited him, knowing the cost. </strong></p><p>Jesus has invited in despite knowing the cost to himself. He wanted it that badly, and he'll carry us through those places we find ourselves incapable of carrying ourselves. That's what he died for.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 29, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/tags/analogies/">Analogies</a></li><li><a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/tags/grace/">Grace</a></li><li><a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/tags/language/">Language</a></li><li><a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/tags/rambling/">Rambling</a></li><li><a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/tags/semantics/">Semantics</a></li><li><a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/tags/theology/">Theological</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmessinground.github.io%2FWaypoint%2Fp%2Fexpectations%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmessinground.github.io%2FWaypoint%2Fp%2Fexpectations%2F&amp;via=JosephBurnash&amp;text=What%20is%20%22expected%22%20vs%20what%20is%20%22required%22" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmessinground.github.io%2FWaypoint%2Fp%2Fexpectations%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=What%20is%20%22expected%22%20vs%20what%20is%20%22required%22" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/p/the-singh-twins/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The Singh twins 🧑‍🤝‍🧑</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/p/wrestling-needs-to-be-more-absurd/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Wrestling needs to be more absurd</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item"><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-12-17T11:03" class="feed__date">December 17, 2025</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/p/wrestling-needs-to-be-more-absurd/">Wrestling needs to be more absurd</a></h3></header><p>A while back Charlie (Penguin0 on YouTube) talked about a wrestling match he saw where Jesus was one of the competitors.
