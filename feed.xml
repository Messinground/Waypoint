            <![CDATA[
                <p>I was cleaning out my phone the other day and found a pitch-black video from June 2022 where I recorded some thoughts I had completely forgotten about:</p>
<p>When use the word "expectations," we're rarely <i>actually </i>talking about what's "expected."</p>
<ul>
<li>No teacher truly anticipates that they are going to go a full school year without anyone failing, missing an assignment, or talking out of turn.</li>
<li>No boss is going to predict that all of their employees are going to come in on time 100% of the time, meet every quota, and memorize every policy perfectly.</li>
<li>No one is shocked when they drive out onto the road and encounter other drivers who speed, tailgate, act obliviously, or look at their phone on the highway.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's standard to call all of those things "expectations," but they're not things we genuinely expect from others - or at least not 100% of the time.</p>
<h5>What we're really talking about here are <strong>standards, norms, and requirements.</strong></h5>
<p>A teacher requires you to act a certain way, but they never expect total compliance. Same goes for your boss. And when someone doesn't comply - there are consequences.</p>
<p>One thought led to another and I asked myself:</p>
<h2>What are God's expectations?</h2>
<p>He sets a high standard. Don't even look at someone with <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A21-22&amp;version=ESV">hatred in your heart</a>. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A27-28&amp;version=ESV">Or lust.</a> Forgive everyone <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fsearch%3DMatthew%2B18%253A21-22%26version%3DESV">every time.</a> Treat even your enemy <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A27-31&amp;version=ESV">as you want to be treated.</a> Be <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A12-13&amp;version=ESV">willing to die</a> for those you love (which should mean everyone.) These are what we might call his "expectations." But what does he actually <em>expect</em>?</p>
<p>He anticipates that we've <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&amp;version=ESV">already sinned.</a> He knows that we <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+7%3A20&amp;version=ESV">continue to sin.</a> And he predicts that in our imperfection, we will unfortunately <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A8-10&amp;version=ESV">keep on sinning.</a></p>
<p>Even so: <strong>1 John 2:1 </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are four obvious takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>He does not want us to keep sinning</li>
<li>God and his people actively work to minimize sin</li>
<li>He isn't surprised by the fact that we keep sinning anyway</li>
<li>He prepared for it and made a plan to deal with it</li>
</ol>
<p>So note to self:</p>
<h3>Stop punishing yourself for being imperfect</h3>
<p>Let's say Jeff invites Andrew on a hike, but Jeff knows Andrew is in a wheelchair. Andrew says no at first, knowing he would progress a lot slower and couldn't go to all the same places that Jeff can. He's just not capable. But Jeff is persistent. He asks and asks Andrew to join him until he finally gives in.</p>
<p>So should Andrew beat himself up for slowing Jeff down? Should Andrew be upset when he has to really on Jeff to carry him and his wheelchair through unpaved sections of the trail? Of course not! <strong>Jeff invited him, knowing the cost. </strong></p>
<p>Jesus has invited in despite knowing the cost to himself. He wanted it that badly, and he'll carry us through those places we find ourselves incapable of carrying ourselves. That's what he died for.</p>

<p>Such lobsters’s reported rarity can fall anywhere from 1/1,000,000 to 1 in 10,000,000 (depending on your source). An excessive production of proteins combined with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astaxanthin">astaxanthin</a> create the unusual blue color. However, it seems equally likely to me that their parents were simply fed an incredible number of blueberries – thus creating a blueberry flavored lobster.</p>

<h2>Cause of discoloration</h2>
<p>Per an article on <a href="https://www.shrimpnews.com/FreeReportsFolder/LobsterFolder/Why%20Are%20Some%20Lobsters%20Blue.html">Shrimpnews.com</a>, their Blue color can more accurately be attributed as such:</p>
<blockquote>Once inside the lobster, things get more complicated. The shell of the lobster has three layers, and the pigment (called astaxanthin) is found in all of them. In the innermost layer, the epidermis, the pigment is incorporated without any changes, showing off the original bright red. As it travels further to outer layer, it forms even larger clusters that look yellow.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In a living lobster, these beautiful bright colors appear all mixed together, creating a dingy brown. There may be hints of blue around the tail, but nothing that reveals the intricate colors underneath. There are exceptions. In one in every million or so lobsters, the layering doesn’t work as it should. If both the top and bottom layers of the shell fail to incorporate the pigment, you get a regal, bright blue lobster</blockquote>

<p>In cats, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoiseshell_cat">Tortoiseshell </a>coats are associated with the X chromosome, thus they normally only appear in females.</p>
<p><strong>Male Tortoiseshells</strong>, however, are not unheard of. This can be caused by chimerism or mosaicism - where the cat is born with cells containing both male and female genetics. This can also be caused by Klinefelter syndrome, where the cat is born with XXY chromosomes.</p>
<p>Calico cats are identical to tortoiseshell in every way except that their undercoat is white, wherease tortoiseshells' undercoats are black. Thus there have also been <a href="https://messinground.github.io/Waypoint/p/calico-gynandromorph/">Calico Gynanders</a></p>
<p>Tortoiseshells are considered good luck in Ireland and Japan.</p>
