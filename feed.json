            "content_html": "<p>Ever since I watched Disney's <em>Soul</em> (great movie) I've had one particular scene stuck in my head. Terry, the otherworldly counsellor for the afterlife, is making a joke: \"It’s not your time. Unless you keep eating those processed foods, am I right?\" But after laughing for a moment, he turns serious and says \"<em>But seriously, stay away from those processed foods.\" </em></p>\n<p>I'm a health nut (sometimes more in theory than in practice.) And I will spend hours researching various tricks and methods to make myself 1% healthier. But I also love junk food. I love Taco Bell and gas station snacks, so it puts a real damper on my day to know they're basically sodium bombs to my body.</p>\n<h2>Why is Ultra-Processed food bad?</h2>\n<p>My biggest takeaway from all that research was that 'ultra-processed' foods are bad for you for three main reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They strip away healthy things like fibre, vitamins, antioxidants, and electrolytes (other than sodium.) Either because they are easier to mass produce that way, it helps get the texture they want, or because it makes it taste better.</li>\n<li>They pack in enormous amounts of sugar, sodium, and carcinogens to transform it from a normal food into an addictive super-stimuli</li>\n<li>There are a lot of steps to get it to become the final product that we end up with. Which means more opportunities for something to go wrong. i.e. heavy metals leeching into the food from industrial processes, microplastics from packaging, and the inclusion of ingredients that haven't been studied very much (but boy are they colourful and tasty.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The alternative is, of course, \"whole\" and minimally processed foods. Food that hasn't gone through very many steps before being put in your mouth. Other than fruits and vegetables, other things that fall into this category are eggs, milk, nuts, poultry, and fish. The kind of things you see in a Thanksgiving spread.</p>\n<p>But then the other day I heard someone refer to <em>TikTok</em> as \"ultra-processed information.\" And the more I think about it, the more perfect that analogy feels.</p>\n<h2>Ultra-Processed Information</h2>\n<p>If \"whole foods\" are naturally occurring, and only go through 1-3 changes before being consumed, then we can think of \"<strong>whole information</strong>\" in the same way: Information that is given to us directly from the source or someone who can reputably interpret that data for us. It might not be easy to digest, it might not always feel good going down, but it's good to know.</p>\n<p>But what if we did to information the same thing we do to processed food? Get rid of all that hard-to-digest, bland stuff that doesn't \"taste\" good. Remove what makes me feel:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Uncomfortable: </strong>The cost of living isn't \"out of control,\" the market is just \"volatile.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Challenged</strong>: Internet algorithms aren't exploiting your dopaminergic systems to keep you addicted, they're \"personalising your content suggestions.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Convicted</strong>: That pork wasn't made in what is basically an animal torture camp, after all - the label says \"Farm Fresh!\" </li>\n<li><strong>Confused</strong>: Climate change isn't a complex domino effect with a wide range of factors and consequences, it's just \"global warming.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But that's just subtractive processing. Ultra processed foods contain additives: stuff that makes it \"tastier.\" Even if contains no nutritional value. <strong>We can make information more palatable too</strong> - even if it winds up containing no real informational value. You can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make it exciting. </strong>\"Facebook is going to give you $1000 if you share this post!\"</li>\n<li><strong>Make it scary</strong>: \"5G will control your mind! Ignore this warning at your own peril!\"</li>\n<li><strong>Make it shocking</strong>: \"It takes 7 years to digest gum, isn't that crazy?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Make it mysterious</strong>: \"We only use 10% of our brain, what if we found a way to use more?\"</li>\n<li><strong>Make a scapegoat</strong>: \"Our economic problems are <em>their</em> fault.\"</li>\n<li><strong>Make it enraging</strong>: \"Light bulbs were made to burn out quickly so we'd be forced to buy replacements more often. How unfair is that?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the Buzzfeed strategy for making stories that sell. \"If it bleeds, it reads.\" But it gets worse.</p>\n<p>It's highly unlikely that if someone offers you an apple, it will turn out to be a convincing play dough sculpture. Not so with information. Thanks to the emergence of AI, even information that <em>seems</em> legitimate and trustworthy might turn out to be a convincing amalgamation of algorithmic training data. More than half of the internet's content is ai-generated now. Even the most earnest of reporters are constantly running the risk of accidentally using hallucinated data as a reference.</p>\n<h2>Ultra-Processed Relationships</h2>\n<p>If you've made it this far, the analogy should be obvious. The \"whole\" and \"unprocessed\" version of a relationship is what we get in person. We brave awkward social situations, we make eye contact, we clean ourselves up to be presentable, and we take risks. If all goes well, we're rewarded with deep connections, meaningful interactions, and a sense of purpose and belonging.</p>\n<p>At first the radio and the telephone were ways to engage in long-distance connections that would have been impossible before. But as is our habit, we love to remove all the parts of life we don't like. So we realised that we could exploit these technologies to avoid all the painful, scary, risky parts of socialising. All the \"fibre,\" so to speak.</p>\n<p>That alone wouldn't have been enough for most people. We have a <em>powerful</em> need to socialise and phone calls just don't cut it. But as technology progressed, <strong>we found new, <em>increasingly hollow</em> ways of making isolated \"relationships\" more palatable</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gamification:</strong> Like a gambling machine. Endless novelty in a never-ending feed. Unpredictability, bells &amp; whistles, and imaginary 'points' to substitute for real affirmation</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility: </strong>A frictionless experience. You don't even need to type in a code to unlock your phone anymore, just look at it with facial recognition. </li>\n<li><strong>Even lower risk</strong>: Here's thousands of people to swipe on and talk to online. They don't like you? No worries - you'll never see them again. You can even block them. You can change your username. Pass without a trace.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #02192b;\"><strong>Performativity:</strong></span> Everyone loves posting their wins and their favourite photos. It's a highlight reel. Skip the small talk. Skip the ice breakers. No need to ask \"what's up,\" and no need to come up with a response when they say \"nothing much.\" Forget about the mundanity, the sorrows, and the pains of life. That stuff is awkward to talk about anyway. Just <em>perform </em>and let the digital applause roll in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a blessed few who do manage to make deep connections that exist solely online. But even the deepest connections of that sort tend to fall short of the fullness of human relationship. Eye contact, physical proximity, and body language all leave deep lasting impact on a person's sense of affection, their serotonin levels, and their sense of belonging.</p>\n<h2>Ultra-processed life</h2>\n<p>Talk of a loneliness epidemic are as prevalent as ever. Misinformation is at an all time high. And despite medical advances - overall cancer rates have only gone down <a href=\"https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/\">4% in the last 12 years</a>. </p>\n<p>It makes me wonder where else I might be cutting out unsavoury - yet necessary things from my life. What have I substituted with something empty, but hyper-stimulating?</p>\n<p>Sometimes I trade slow sanctification for quick and flashy revivals; reflections and study for google and ChatGPT; or deep, personal prayers for quotable alliterations or chiasmuses. Empty calories.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>A while back Charlie (Penguin0 on YouTube) talked about a wrestling match he saw where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr9qrIOI7cM\">Jesus was one of the competitors</a>. He was using telekinesis and everyone was playing it up like it was real. I bet that would have been a HILARIOUS show to watch.</p>\n<p>This sent me down the rabbit hole. What other wrestling matches just threw plausibility out the window in favor of entertainment? My dad showed me a match between <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cslu7zFmPjM\">two invisible wrestlers</a> where the only way to follow what was happening was by watching the ref's reaction, as he wore \"invisibility glasses.\"</p>\n<p>It got me thinking about how wrestling is planned out ahead of time. It takes real athleticism, but nevertheless the majority of hits are purposely choreographed to be safer. Sometimes there's never any real contact at all. And impressive as the athleticism is, it's hard for people like me to get invested when the artificiality of the fights are so evident. Every movie requires suspension of disbelief, but wrestling requires a little too much, I think.</p>\n<p>Which begs the question: why bother with realism at all? Throw it out the window! Make absurdity like telekinesis and invisibility regularly recurring themes. In WWE the closest thing I've seen is how they'll sometimes bring puppets into fights and treat them like real living people/animals. They could REALLY kick it up a few notches.</p>\n<p>Proof of concept: you could easily introduce a character who's just a middle-aged guy that keeps accidentally walking into the wrong room. He wears business casual because he just came from the office. Every character has a theme song, so <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUREF3bL4ec&amp;pp=ygUSc291cHkgZ2FyYmFnZSByb29t0gcJCTwKAYcqIYzv\">this is his.</a> How can such a character compete? Accidently. He spends every match running away and dodging hits, then in loony-toons fashion, somehow ends up winning every fight until every wrestler is terrified at the sight of him.</p>\n<figure class=\"d1fekHMv2WPYZzgPAV7b\"><img  src=\"https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FiPK9RpCTL1Y%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1&amp;ipt=10a8b41ac1d6ae18eeb75fc5bd6918365d6f90b5a977fe8150c5236a607a6dfd\" alt=\"MR.

Andrew says no at first, knowing he would progress a lot slower and couldn't go to all the same places that Jeff can. He's just not capable. But Jeff is persistent. He asks and asks Andrew to join him until he finally gives in.</p>\n<p>So should Andrew beat himself up for slowing Jeff down? Should Andrew be upset when he has to really on Jeff to carry him and his wheelchair through unpaved sections of the trail? Of course not! <strong>Jeff invited him, knowing the cost. </strong></p>\n<p>Jesus has invited in despite knowing the cost to himself. He wanted it that badly, and he'll carry us through those places we find ourselves incapable of carrying ourselves. That's what he died for.</p>",

The shell of the lobster has three layers, and the pigment (called astaxanthin) is found in all of them. In the innermost layer, the epidermis, the pigment is incorporated without any changes, showing off the original bright red. As it travels further to outer layer, it forms even larger clusters that look yellow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>In a living lobster, these beautiful bright colors appear all mixed together, creating a dingy brown. There may be hints of blue around the tail, but nothing that reveals the intricate colors underneath. There are exceptions. In one in every million or so lobsters, the layering doesn’t work as it should. If both the top and bottom layers of the shell fail to incorporate the pigment, you get a regal, bright blue lobster</blockquote>\n<p> </p>",
